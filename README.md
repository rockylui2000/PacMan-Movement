# PacMan-Movement
PacMan moving simulation project
<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>This program intends to demonstrate how to use JavaScript to create a PacMan figure moving back and forth across a browser window. The program is able to detect the boundary of the window and reverses the PacMan moving directions.
</p>
<h1>Installation:</h1>
<p>Download a copy of the PacMan File folder. Drag and drop index.html onto a blank webpage and you can see PacMan moving back and fourth on the page.</p>
<h1>Usage:</h1>
<p>It will help you to create simple animation from only 4 images of PacMan. Moreover, it can help you to understand how to detect the edges of a brower window as well as reversing directions of movement when the edges are touched.</p>
<h1>Support:</h1>
<p>You can contact me at richard@deal-commerce.com for any support.</p>
<h1>Roadmap:</h1>
<p>I plan to add instruct PacMan to move around all 4 corners of the window.</p>
